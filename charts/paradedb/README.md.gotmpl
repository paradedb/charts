# ParadeDB Helm Chart

The [ParadeDB](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb) Helm Chart is based on the official [CloudNativePG Helm Chart](https://cloudnative-pg.io/). CloudNativePG is a Kubernetes operator that manages the full lifecycle of a highly available PostgreSQL database cluster with a primary/standby architecture using Postgres streaming (physical) replication.

Kubernetes, and specifically the CloudNativePG operator, is the recommended approach for deploying ParadeDB in production, with high availability. ParadeDB also provides a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/paradedb/paradedb) and [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases) for Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and macOS.

The ParadeDB Helm Chart supports Postgres 15+ and ships with Postgres 18 by default.

The chart is also available on [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/paradedb/paradedb).

## Usage

### ParadeDB Bring-Your-Own-Cloud (BYOC)

The most reliable way to run ParadeDB in production is with ParadeDB BYOC, an end-to-end managed solution that runs in the customer’s cloud account. It deploys on managed Kubernetes services and uses the ParadeDB Helm Chart.

ParadeDB BYOC includes built-in integration with managed PostgreSQL services, such as AWS RDS and GCP CloudSQL, via logical replication. It also provides monitoring, logging and alerting through Prometheus and Grafana. The ParadeDB team manages the underlying infrastructure and lifecycle of the cluster.

You can read more about the optimal architecture for running ParadeDB in production [here](https://docs.paradedb.com/deploy/overview) and you can contact sales [here](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

### Self-Hosted

First, install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). The following steps assume you have a Kubernetes cluster running v1.29+. If you are testing locally, we recommend using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

#### Monitoring

The ParadeDB Helm chart supports monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana. To enable monitoring, you need to have the Prometheus CRDs installed before installing the CloudNativePG operator. The Promotheus CRDs can be found [here](https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts).

#### Installing the CloudNativePG Operator

Skip this step if the CloudNativePG operator is already installed in your cluster. For advanced CloudNativePG configuration and monitoring, please refer to the [CloudNativePG Cluster Chart documentation](https://github.com/paradedb/charts/blob/main/charts/cloudnative-pg/README.md#values).

```bash
helm repo add cnpg https://cloudnative-pg.github.io/charts
helm upgrade --atomic --install cnpg \
--create-namespace \
--namespace cnpg-system \
cnpg/cloudnative-pg
```

#### Setting up a ParadeDB CNPG Cluster

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When deploying a cluster with more than one instance, you must use `type: paradedb-enterprise` to enable replication of BM25 indexes across instances.
> Using ParadeDB Enterprise requires an access token. To request one, please [contact sales](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

Create a `values.yaml` and configure it to your requirements. Here is a basic example:

```yaml
type: paradedb
mode: standalone

version:
  # -- PostgreSQL major version to use
  postgresql: "18"
  # -- ParadeDB version to use
  paradedb: "0.21.2"

cluster:
  instances: 1
  storage:
    size: 256Mi
```

Then, launch the ParadeDB cluster.

```bash
helm repo add paradedb https://paradedb.github.io/charts
helm upgrade --atomic --install paradedb \
--namespace paradedb \
--create-namespace \
--values values.yaml \
paradedb/paradedb
```

If `--values values.yaml` is omitted, the default values will be used. For advanced ParadeDB configuration and monitoring, please refer to the [ParadeDB Chart documentation](https://github.com/paradedb/charts/tree/dev/charts/paradedb#values).

#### Connecting to a ParadeDB CNPG Cluster

You can launch a Bash shell inside a specific pod via:

```bash
kubectl exec --stdin --tty <pod-name> -n paradedb -- bash
```

The primary is called `paradedb-1`. The replicas are called `paradedb-2` onwards depending on the number of replicas you configured. You can connect to the ParadeDB database with `psql` via:

```bash
psql -d paradedb
```

## Development

To test changes to the Chart on a local Minikube cluster, follow the instructions from [Self Hosted](#self-hosted) replacing the `helm upgrade` step by the path to the directory of the modified `Chart.yaml`.

```bash
helm upgrade --atomic --install paradedb --namespace paradedb --create-namespace ./charts/paradedb
```

## Advanced Cluster Configuration

### Database Types

To create a ParadeDB cluster, you must specify either `paradedb` or `paradedb-enterprise` via the `type` parameter.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using `paradedb-enterprise` you must also specify the `cluster.imagePullSecrets` containing the Docker registry credentials. You can create one with:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl -n NAMESPACE create secret docker-registry paradedb-enterprise-registry-cred --docker-server="https://index.docker.io/v1/" --docker-username="USERNAME" --docker-password="ACCESS_TOKEN"
> ```
>
> You then need to set the name of the secret in the `values.yaml` file with:
>
> ```yaml
> type: paradedb-enterprise
> cluster:
>   imagePullSecrets:
>    - name: paradedb-enterprise-registry-cred
> ```

### Modes of Operation

The chart has three modes of operation. These are configured via the `mode` parameter:

* `standalone` - Creates new or updates an existing CNPG cluster. This is the default mode.
* `replica` - Creates a replica cluster from an existing CNPG cluster. **_Note_ that this mode is not yet supported.**
* `recovery` - Recovers a CNPG cluster from a backup, object store or via pg_basebackup.

### Backup Configuration

CNPG implements disaster recovery via [Barman](https://pgbarman.org/). The following section configures the barman object
store where backups will be stored. Barman performs backups of the cluster filesystem base backup and WALs. Both are
stored in the specified location. The backup provider is configured via the `backups.provider` parameter. The following
providers are supported:

* S3 or S3-compatible stores, like MinIO
* Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
* Google Cloud Storage

Additionally you can specify the following parameters:

* `backups.retentionPolicy` - The retention policy for backups. Defaults to `30d`.
* `backups.scheduledBackups` - An array of scheduled backups containing a name and a crontab schedule. Example:

```yaml
backups:
  scheduledBackups:
    - name: daily-backup
      schedule: "0 0 0 * * *" # Daily at midnight
      backupOwnerReference: self
```

Each backup adapter takes it's own set of parameters, listed in the [Configuration options](#Configuration-options) section
below. Refer to the table for the full list of parameters and place the configuration under the appropriate key: `backup.s3`,
`backup.azure`, or `backup.google`.

## Recovery

There is a separate document outlining the recovery procedure here: **[Recovery](docs/recovery.md)**

## Monitoring

The ParadeDB Helm chart supports monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. The chart includes a comprehensive Grafana dashboard that provides complete monitoring for both PostgreSQL/cluster operations and ParadeDB-specific search and analytics features. The dashboard is provisioned as a ConfigMap that works with the Grafana sidecar to automatically import dashboards. You can enable this by setting `monitoring.grafanaDashboard.create`.

**Note:** This is a complete, all-in-one dashboard that includes both standard CloudNativePG monitoring (replication, backups, storage, WAL, connections) and ParadeDB-specific metrics (pg_search, BM25 search, index segments). You do not need to install any additional dashboards.

### Dashboard Features

The comprehensive dashboard includes monitoring for:

**PostgreSQL & Cluster Management:**
- Physical Replication (lag, write/flush/replay lag)
- Backups & WAL archiving status
- Storage usage and disk I/O
- Server health (CPU, memory, TPS)
- Connection states and transactions
- Logical replication metrics

**ParadeDB Search & Analytics:**
- BM25 index segments and sizes
- `pg_search` performance metrics
- Search-specific analytics
- Index layer monitoring

Alternatively, you can manually import the dashboard from the `monitoring` directory.

### Metrics Configuration

Additionally, we recommend enabling the `kube-state-metrics` CRD monitoring and adding the CNPG metrics. The configuration can be found in `monitoring/metrics-clusters_postgresql_cnpg_io.yaml`.

## Examples

There are several configuration examples in the [examples](examples) directory. Refer to them for a basic setup and
refer to  the [CloudNativePG Documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/) for more advanced configurations.
